**Evaluating the 50c Fare Initiative: A Data Analysis of Gold Coast Transport Systems**

This project analyzes the impact of the Queensland Government‚Äôs 50-cent public transport fare initiative, introduced on August 6, 2024. The aim is to evaluate whether this initiative influenced traffic congestion, delay hours, and public transport usage in the City of Gold Coast.

---

**Project Scope**

- Time Period: 2022‚Äì2024
- Key Focus Areas:
  - Public transport ridership changes
  - Traffic volume fluctuations
  - Delay hours before vs. after fare trial
  - Predictive modelling (Linear Regression, ARIMA)

---

**Repository Structure**

- `/notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks with delay hours and public transport analysis
- `/data`: Cleaned datasets used for analysis and visualizations  
- `/qgis`: QGIS geospatial project files
- `/docs`: Public-facing documents including proposal, user manuals, final report, and presentation  
- `/readme`: Markdown user guides for notebooks
- `README.md`: This file  
- `.gitignore`: Lists files/folders to exclude from Git version control  
- `LICENSE`: MIT License

**Tech Stack**

- Python 3.7+  
  - pandas, matplotlib, seaborn  
  - scikit-learn (for linear regression)  
  - statsmodels (for ARIMA forecasting)  
- Jupyter Notebooks

**Key Deliverables**

- üìà Public Transport Usage Trends: Year-over-year comparisons and mode share analysis
- ‚è±Ô∏è Delay Hours: Monthly trends, time-of-day segmentation, and pre/post trial comparison
- üöó Volume Analysis: Aggregated traffic volumes and top contributing links
- üîÆ Forecasts: Linear regression and ARIMA modeling for future delay trends
